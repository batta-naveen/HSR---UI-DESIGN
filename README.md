HSR Motors, a car dealership, is struggling to manage and track leads efficiently. Currently, they
are using a spreadsheet to track lead statuses, but this process lacks real-time collaboration and
a more effective workflow. The company needs a streamlined solution that allows the sales team
to manage leads, track progress, and ensure effective communication. Additionally, the business
manager needs a quick and clear overview of the lead data to make informed decisions.
The main goal is to design a web application that will centralize lead management and
enhance collaboration.
The users involved are the Sales Team, who need tools to qualify leads and track
progress, and the Business Manager, who requires a high-level dashboard for insights.
The application needs to help teams transition from manual, spreadsheet-based tracking
to a more automated, modern, and collaborative environment.
